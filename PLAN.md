### Task 1: Define Requirements

- **Goal**: Clearly outline the scope and features of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
- **Steps**:
  1. **Core Features**:
     - Map integration to show basketball courts and their location.
     - Search functionality by location or court name.
     - Display basic court information (name, address, type).
  2. **Future Features** (for later iterations):
     - User reviews and ratings.
     - Add new courts via user input.
     - Filter options (indoor/outdoor, lighting, etc.).
     - Check in feature and social chatrooms
     - Pick-up game organiser and record

### Task 2: Design Wireframes

- **Goal**: Create a visual blueprint for the app's key screens.
- **Tools**: Figma, Sketch, or Canva (free tools work fine).
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify key screens needed for MVP:
     - **Home Screen**: Interactive map with markers for courts.
     - **Court Detail Screen**: Displays court-specific information.
     - **Add Court Screen**: Simple form for submitting new courts.
  2. Draft basic layouts for each screen:
     - Map screen should have a search bar at the top and clickable markers.
     - Detail screen should include a title, address, court type, and a back button.
     - Add court screen needs input fields for name, address, and court type.
  3. Keep designs minimal and functional.
  4. Save/export wireframes as images for reference during development.

### Task 3: Set Up Development Environment

- **Goal**: Prepare all necessary tools and frameworks to begin coding.
- **Steps**:
  1. Install **Node.js**:
     - Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
  2. Set up **React Native**:
     - Install React Native CLI: `npm install -g react-native-cli`.
     - Initialize a new project: `npx react-native init BasketballCourtApp`.
  3. Configure a version control system:
     - Create a GitHub repository.
     - Set up local Git:
       - Initialize: `git init`.
       - Add remote: `git remote add origin <repository_url>`.
  4. Install basic dependencies:
     - **React Navigation**: `npm install @react-navigation/native`.
     - **Maps API**:
       - For Google Maps: `npm install react-native-maps`.
       - Get an API key from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
  5. Test the environment:
     - Run the project in an emulator or physical device to confirm setup.
